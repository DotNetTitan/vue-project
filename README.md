## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 20 or later)
- **npm** (included with Node.js installation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

### Development

To start the development server:

```

This will start the Vite server and hot-reload the project on changes.

## IDE Setup

We recommend using **Visual Studio Code** for development, with the following extensions:
- **Volar** (for Vue 3 support) â€“ disable Vetur if installed.
- **ESLint** (for consistent code quality)

## TypeScript Support

The project uses `vue-tsc` for static type checking. The Volar extension in VS Code enhances TypeScript support in `.vue` files.

## Customization

You can modify the Vite configuration to suit your needs. Refer to the [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more details.

## Tailwind CSS

Styling is done using **Tailwind CSS**. The configuration file for customizing Tailwind can be found at `tailwind.config.js`.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions is configured for CI/CD. The workflow configuration is located in `.github/workflows`.
